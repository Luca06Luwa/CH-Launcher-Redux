# CH-Launcher-Redux
This is a complete open source version of a basic Clone Hero Updater (that I called a launcher).

It's currently in very early stages and having help from the community would be appriciated.

Current things I need to add:
---
- Api to detect and update CH PTB and Launcher
- Implement a basic UI that just makes it useable
- Colour profile creator
- CH Settings Editor
