# CH-Launcher-Redux
This is a complete open source version of a basic Clone Hero Updater (that I called a launcher).

It's currently in very early stages and having help from the community would be appriciated.

Current things I need to add:

-- Api to detect and update PTB builds
-- Implement a basic UI
-- Colour profile creator
