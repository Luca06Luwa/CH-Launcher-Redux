# CH-Launcher-Redux
This is a complete open source version of a basic Clone Hero Updater (that I called a launcher).

It's currently in very early stages and is closed source but I will make the cobebase open source once I feel like it's in a state where I feel it's ready.

Current things I need to add:
---
- Api to detect and update CH PTB and Launcher
- Implement a basic UI that just makes it useable
- Colour profile creator
- CH Settings Editor

Having help from the Guitar Hero/Clone Hero/ScoreSpy community would be appriciated as it helps me speed up the development of the launcher.
