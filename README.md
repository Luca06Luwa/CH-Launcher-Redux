# Clone Hero Control Panel

This project has been archived as the upstream devs of clone hero have already came up with their own solution.

I have left the original description along with some of the early stage things that I needed to add.

If the devs want me to, I could continue with this project, however it's been quite tricky when testing.

# Original description

This is a complete open source version of a basic Clone Hero Control Panel.

It's currently in very early stages and is closed source but I will make the cobebase open source once I feel like it's in a state where I feel it's ready.

Note that I wont be obfuscating the code as I want people to decompile it and fix errors that I made in the test builds.

Current things I need to add:
---
- Api to detect and update CH PTB
- Implement a basic UI that just makes it useable
- Colour profile creator
- CH Settings Editor

Contribution

Having help from the Guitar Hero/Clone Hero/ScoreSpy community would be appriciated as it helps me speed up the development of the control panel.
